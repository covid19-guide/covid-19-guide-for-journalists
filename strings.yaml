    <p>The goal of this document is to help newsroom managers provide clear, useful guidance to their reporters and editors during a period in which we lack official institutional direction on how best to respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>None of this is medical advice—it is a framework to help you create an environment in which your teams can better cope with disruption and uncertainty.</p>
    <p>Nor is this document meant to be exhaustive or overly prescriptive, though we think you’ll find it a useful template to adapt to the specific needs of your newsroom.</p>
    <p>If you have questions, comments, feedback, or suggestions: Find us in the <a href="https://newsnerdery.org/">News Nerdery Slack</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/covid19opsguide">on Twitter</a>.</p>
    <p>Good luck and wash your hands!</p>
