    The goal of this document is to help newsroom managers provide clear, useful guidance to their reporters and editors during a period in which we lack official institutional direction on how best to respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
    None of this is medical advice — it is instead a framework to help you create an environment in which your teams can better cope with disruption and uncertainty.
    Nor is this document meant to be exhaustive or overly prescriptive, though we think you’ll find it a useful template to adapt to the specific needs of your newsroom.
    If you have questions, comments, feedback, or suggestions: Find us in the NewsNerd Slack or on Twitter.
    Good luck and wash your hands!
